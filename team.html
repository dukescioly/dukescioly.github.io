									<p>I’m a junior majoring in Environmental Science and Policy with minors in Earth/Ocean Science
										and Education. I have been doing Science Olympiad since 6th grade and I went to Lower Merion High
										School in Pennsylvania. My favorite events are Experimental Design, Wright Stuff, Bridges, and
										Geologic Mapping. When I’m not in class, I am working with Dining programs, First-year programs,
										or working out for ski team. Some of my hobbies are playing cello and guitar, cooking, and recycling.</p>

									<p>I went to Carmel High School and was part of Science Olympiad all four years.
										My favorite event was WIDI, but I also liked Hydrogeology and Protein Modeling.
										I built a lot of Towers and did Experimental Design, but would not call those favorites by any
										definition of the word. Outside of scioly and class, I also play for Swerve, the women's ultimate
										frisbee team, write/edit for The Chronicle, design for DIDA, and volunteer as part of APO. I enjoy
										reading, baking, and drawing/painting in my free time.

									<p>Brian spent all four years of high school in Science Olympiad,
										two of which he served as the building captain for his team. In that time, eating
										ramen at 4 am the morning before a competition and pulling all-nighters only to
										produce unsuccessful results became his forte. Out of spite, he has decided to commit
										himself to passing those nerve-wracking experiences onto the next generation of high schoolers.
										Feel free to reach out to him with any questions as he is all too eager to help!<p>

										I competed with the Northville High School Science Olympiad team throughout high school,
										and my favorite events include Invasive Species, Rocks and Minerals, and Protein Modeling.
										In my free time, I love dancing, eating ice cream, journaling, and hiking. I'm extremely
										excited to give back to a community that has meant so much to me by helping run the 2019 Duke Science Olympiad Invitational!

										my Montgomery High School team for my last two years. My favorite events are Microbe Mission, Experimental Design, and (dare I say) Game On.
										I also love biking, UX design, crossword puzzles, Medium articles, and travelling!

									studying math and computer science. In my free time, I play tennis, watch The Office
									on repeat, and argue with friends about how ramps are just a subset of stairs.
									Back in the day, I competed in Dynamic Planet, Remote Sensing, GeoMapping and all
									those other earth science events.</p>

										My name is Daniel Edward Chun-Chei Tsai! I am a sophomore from Philadelphia and
										I previously attended Lower Merion High School - the old stomping ground of NBA
										superstar Kobe Bryant and the lesser known superstar Allie Rauch. A little about me:
										I enjoy long walks on the beach, a good Nicolas Cage movie, and any building event
										Scioly has to offer. Some fun facts about me include that I have a birthmark that
										looks like a smiley face, I own 7 Jeremy Lin and Yao Ming jerseys, and in high school
										I came in second in an all-male beauty pageant.</p>

										Black Mirror, Stranger Things, and on and on...) going to basketball games,  painting,
										and looking at dogspotting on Facebook!
